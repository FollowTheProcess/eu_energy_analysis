## Install Instructions

If you want to install this project to run the code or experiment with it. Follow the below steps precisely.

*You will need the [conda package manager](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) to recreate the environment*

Clone the repo into your desired local directory

Navigate to the project root:

``` bash
cd <your_absolute_path_to_eu_energy_analysis>
```

Create the project environment from the environment.yml:

``` bash
conda env create --file environment.yml
```

Install the project in editable mode (Note the . telling pip to install from the current directory):

``` bash
pip install -e .
```

Download the data:

``` bash
